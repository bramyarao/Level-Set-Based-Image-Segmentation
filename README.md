# Level Set Based Image Segmentation
## This work is copyrighted.

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
In this work, image segmentation is carried out using the Active contours without edges (ACWE) framework. The final Euler-Lagrange equations obtained after minimizing the functional are solved numerically using semi-implicit scheme.

###  Active contours without edges (ACWE)
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The ACWE method was proposed by Chan and Vese and is derived from the piecewise constant Mumford-Shah functional in a level set framework for image segmentation. The review of the level set function, ACWE segmentation method, numerical solution and results are given in <a href="Latex/ACWE.pdf" target="blank">this pdf</a>.

The coding is done in MATLAB. The segmentation is shown below:
